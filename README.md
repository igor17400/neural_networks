# My Neural Network Learning Journey

Welcome to my dedicated space for sharing insights, knowledge, and courses on neural networks. This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding and building neural networks from the ground up, inspired by pioneers in the field. Through this journey, I aim to demystify the complexities of neural networks and make the learning process accessible to everyone.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a platform where I document my learning path, including detailed notes, code implementations, and reflections on courses and books that have significantly contributed to my understanding of neural networks.

### Courses

#### **Neural Networks: Zero to Hero** by Andrej Karpathy
 
An invaluable course that offers a hands-on approach to building neural networks from scratch.

All the resources are available on the folder `neural_networks_zero_to_hero` where I replicate his code and added some other jupyter notebooks to practice some other topics.

### **Deep Learning** by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville

This book is a cornerstone in the field of deep learning. It offers comprehensive theoretical insights that complement the practical skills I've developed through Karpathy's course.

All the resources are available on the folder `deep_learning_book`. In there, I've shared mainly all my notes through my studies on the subjects (linear algebra, porobability & statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning itself, and more)
